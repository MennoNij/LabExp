# LabExp
A Matlab framework for creating and running paradigms for (cognitive) experiments. Suitable for behavioral, eyetracking, and fMRI experiments. Essentially, it's similar to E-Prime, but takes a more programming-centric approach. In exchange you get a more robust and platform independent experimental paradigm.

See the example directory for a complete experiment implementation.

- Requires PsychToolBox to be installed
- Included tasks are Subtraction, Nback, Tracking (1D and 2D), and Tone counting.
